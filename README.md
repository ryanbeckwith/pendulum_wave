# pendulum_wave
A physically accurate, graphics based simulation of the natural phenomenon known as a pendulum wave.
A pendulum wave consists of a series of carefully chosen pendulums of specific lengths that experience a certain number of oscillations per second to create a periodic wavelike pattern. More information on the topic can be found at https://sciencedemonstrations.fas.harvard.edu/presentations/pendulum-waves.
This program was created for a final project in a calculus-based physics class.
### Controls
space - Starts (or restarts) the simulation.\
v - Displays velocity vectors for each pendulum, if they are not already displayed.\
s - Hides the strings for each pendulum, if they are already displayed.\
b - Hides the bobs for each pendulum, if they are already displayed.\
s - Hides the text overlay, if not already hidden.\
c - Displays an incorrect model of a pendulum wave, if not already displayed.
### Running this program
This program requires a working version of Processing 3.5.3 or later (Java version), which can be downloaded from https://processing.org/download/.
Note that window dimensions are hardcoded, and may not display properly on machines with screen dimensions below 1080p.
