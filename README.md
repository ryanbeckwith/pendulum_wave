# pendulum_wave
A physically accurate, graphics based simulation of the natural phenomenon known as a pendulum wave.
A pendulum wave consists of a series of carefully chosen pendulums of specific lengths that experience a certain number of oscillations per second to create a periodic wavelike pattern. More information on the topic can be found at https://sciencedemonstrations.fas.harvard.edu/presentations/pendulum-waves.
This program was created for a final project in a calculus-based physics class.
